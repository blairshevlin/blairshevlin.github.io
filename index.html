    <h1>Blair Shevlin</h1>
    
    <p>
        I am a translational decision neuroscience researcher. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in two labs.
        My primary appointment is at the Center for Computational Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount 
        Sinai with (<a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bernerlab/">Laura Berner</a>). I am also affiliated with the
        Computational Psychiatry Unit at Yale Medicine with (<a href="https://www.neurocpu.org/">Xiaosi Gu</a>).
        I completed my Ph.D. in Decision Psychology while working in the Neuroeconomics Laboratory at The Ohio State
        University with <a href="https://krajbichlab.psych.ucla.edu/people">Ian Krajbich</a>.
    </p>

        My research tries to answer the question: "How do people decide what to value?" I approach this question by studying both how people learn about value (e.g., "Which product should I buy?") and how they approach situations in which those values may vary (e.g., "How should I approach my choices at a fancy supermarket versus a dollar store?"). I'm interested in answering this question in the context of consumer goods and social interactions, as well as how these valuations go awry in mental illness. My primary tools are computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging.
