    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Computational Psychiatry at the
      Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (with [Xiaosi Gu](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/gulab) and [Laura Berner](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bernerlab/)).
      I earned my Ph.D. while working in the Neuroeconomics Laboratory at The Ohio State 
      University with [Ian Krajbich](https://krajbichlab.psych.ucla.edu/people). 
      
      My research tries to answer the question: "How do people decide what to value?" 
      I approach this question by studying both how people learn about value (e.g., 
      "Which product should I buy?") and how they approach situations in which those 
      values may vary (e.g., "How should I approach my choices at a fancy supermarket 
      versus a dollar store?"). I'm interested in answering this question in the context
      of consumer goods and social interactions, as well as how these valuations go awry 
      in mental illness. My primary tools are computational modeling and functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging. I greatly enjoy tinkering with code and improving workflows. 
      Ultimately, I hope to work on projects that make a positive social impact.
